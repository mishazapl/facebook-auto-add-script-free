# Facebook Auto Add Friends

# How It Works
It's basically Javascript loop that simulates clicks, scrolls page down so the page can load more people into list and if at any point there are any alerts/pop-ups/modals - it listens for them and closes them all. All you need to do is open friends finding page for mobile version.

This script is for test / study purposes only ðŸ˜…

1. Go to mobile version facebook
2. Go to friends page.
3. Open script.js in the repository.
4. Copy and paste to your developer console.
